Paragraph by itself.

Sentence one has two trailing spaces.  
So this sentence should be on a new line in the same paragraph.

Sentence one has no trailing whitespace.
So this sentence should be right after sentence one.

Sentence one has part of sentence two on the same line. Sentence two
is a bit clingy. Sentence three
is ridiculous because
it goes onto three separate lines!
